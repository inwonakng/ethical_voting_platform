## Current tasks that need to be done

#### Team 1
- Survey model creation, delivery to frontend (3 people)
    + Consistant to what Opra uses
    + Design pathway for users to register their survey
    + Design pathway to show survey/record all relevant info 

#### Team 2
- Survey random generation (I will fix my code to be ran in django) (3 people)
    + python file to generate random scenarios with random (and preferably not overlapping) alternatives
    + Will need some consideration later on as well when using active learning

#### Team 3
- Survey design/layout (Should we stick to table, how to make the survey as easily digestable as possible)
    + use js(ts), html, django forms to create a survey page similar to what we have been using
    + keep consistant to opra design scheme

## Tasks to look into in future
- Login/Token creation for mturkers (take look at opra)
